;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package enables the use of an underscore (`_') character in
;; Emacs Shell mode, as a shorthand for a temporary file containing the
;; last shell output.

;;; Usage:
;;
;; See documentation for `shell-underscore-mode'.

;;; Installation:
;;
;; To enable this mode when a shell is opened, put the following in
;; your Emacs init file:

;; (defun my-shell-hook ()
;;   (require 'shell-underscore)
;;   (shell-underscore-mode t))
;;
;; (add-hook 'shell-mode-hook #'my-shell-hook)

;; In case you want to remove the hook, evaluate this expression:

;; (remove-hook 'shell-mode-hook #'my-shell-hook)

;; Please see README.md from the same repository for more
;; documentation.

;;; Limitations:
;;
;; - Only one use of `_' per command invocation is supported.
;; - In case you are working with real files named `_' or `_x', this mode
;;   might not be for you...

;;; TODO
;;
;; - Think about using underscore + number to access the Nth previous
;;   output (_1 would mean the last, _2 second to last, etc.)

(define-minor-mode shell-underscore-mode
  "Toggle shell hacks underscore mode.
Shell underscore mode let you access the last shell output saved
in a file with the shorthand `_'.

That means, you can treat `_' as if it represents a file that
contains the last shell output.  When this feature is used, the
`_' is replaced, behind the scenes, with the name of an actual
file.

There are many uses of this feature.  For example, you might have
executed a long-running command and forgot to redirect the
output, or you realize after-the-fact that you want to use the
output in another command.  It can also be useful when you run a
number of commands after each other, each one transforming the
output of the former, without the need to use a pipe.

Examples:

 $ echo hello
 hello
 $ tr 'h' 'H' < _
 Hello
 $

 $ some complex shell command
 bar
 baz
 foo
 $ grep b _
 bar
 baz
 $

It's also possible to have the underscore in the middle of a command:

 $ cat test
 bar
 baz
 foo
 $ grep b _ | grep z
 baz
 $

Note: In order to work correctly, your prompt can only consist of
one line.  If the prompt consists of several lines, all but the last
one will be part of the output saved in the temporary file.

If you want to access a certain output file later by its real
name (they are not removed automatically), you can find the name
in the following way:

 $ ls _
 /tmp/shell-output-NHuKHW
 $

Each time you use `_' it will be a different file that is
used (because at each command invocation that uses the
underscore, new output is generated and saved).  If you want to
persist a certain output and reuse that for several command
invocations, suffix the `_' with a letter (a-z) or a number.
When you do that, the content in the file will not change if you
refer to it with an underscore and that letter or number again so
you can refer to the same file and therefore file content over
and over again.  If you want to overwrite one of the named output
files, add a `!' after the letter.

Example:

 $ cat foo
 hello
 hi
 hey

 $ grep e _a
 hello
 hey

 $ grep i _a
 hi

 $ cat bar
 bye
 good bye

 $ grep g _a!
 good bye

 $ grep b _a
 bye
 good bye"
